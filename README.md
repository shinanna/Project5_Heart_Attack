# Project5_Heart_Attack

Process:
- Understanding the dataset together
- Planning and splitting the work
- Data cleaning
- EDA 
- Charts in Streamlit
- Uploads on Git

Understanding the dataset: 
1) age
2) sex 
3) chest pain type (4 values)
4) resting blood pressure -- NUM
5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl -- NUM
6) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 
7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) -- NUM
8) thalac: maximum heart rate achieved 
9) exang: exercise induced angina 
10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
11) the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
12) ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14) target: 0= less chance of heart attack 1 = more chance of heart attack == TARGET
